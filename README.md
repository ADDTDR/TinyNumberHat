# TinyNumberHat,  time-traveling hardware prodigy 

Introducing a distinctive open-source hardware project—a compact expansion board centered around the HT16K33 LED driver.

 What sets this apart is its integration of niche, obscure and obsolete displays  from the 1970 Cold War era AL304V and LS314 display ,

adding a touch of history to modern technology.
echoing the simplicity of its Cold War origins. To enhance user interaction
