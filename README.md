# TinyNumberHat,  time-traveling hardware prodigy 

"Introducing a distinctive open-source hardware project‚Äîa compact expansion board centered around the HT16K33 LED driver.

What sets this apart is its integration of niche, obscure, and obsolete displays from the 1970 Cold War era, such as the AL304V, A, or ALS314 display, adding a touch of history to modern technology.

All to enhance user interaction.

The enigmatic 'Tiny Number Hat 9'‚Äîwhere the intrigue of espionage meets the charm of Raspberry Pi expansion hats! This little wonder packs a punch with its AL304V or LS314 components straight from the classified archives of the 1970 Cold War era, as if they were crafted in the shadows of industrial intrigue, bearing a suspicious resemblance to the Monsanto MAN-3 display (which probably was the father of this little creature; the mother is unknown).

Echoing the simplicity of its Cold War origins. Rough and 'a bit how ya going' build quality of displays that vary from one exemplar to another. Not quite aligned top and bottom parts of the package, glue, or varnish residues. Sometimes it makes you think that these displays were built very questionably, though using expensive materials like gold-plated leads. Judging by the look, the case is built with good-quality plastic; after almost 50 years, the case did not disintegrate.

Why 9, you ask? Well, it's not just a number; it's the magic behind the scenes, symbolizing the 8-segment displays that make this hat a numerical wizard. Well, and actual 9 displays placed on the board.
The name "Tiny" isn't just for show. It's a nod to the physical stature of the displays themselves‚Äîsmall, but mighty in their historical significance.

And let's not forget the four fiery red buttons, adding a touch of danger to your every interaction.

So, gear up for a journey where Raspberry Pi meets Cold War espionage, and 'Tiny Number Hat 9' becomes the spy gadget of your open-source dreams! And your project becomes the James Bond of open-source hardware! üé©üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüî¥‚ú®

Displays, having aged as gracefully as the IP protocol, form a perfect duo to showcase the IP address of your Raspberry Pi. This gives you a massive advantage in the uproarious game of 'Guess the IP' on your Raspberry Pi. Get ready for some tech-savvy fun!.

I did that project solely for my own amusement and to spend time doing something enjoyable.
I have definitely enjoyed every minute of it!
