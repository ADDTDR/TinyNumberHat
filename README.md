# TinyNumberHat 
I was looking at some retro displays on https://www.industrialalchemy.org.

One day, I saw those ALS314 displays on a local eBay analog, and I immediately knew that I needed to build something using them.
So, I decided to build an RPi Zero extension hat.

# More ideas to explore 

1. **Multi-digit Clock:**
   - Use the 7-segment displays to create a digital clock with hours, minutes, and seconds. You can include features like time formatting and an adjustable clock speed.

2. **Temperature Monitoring:**
   - Interface temperature sensors with each microcontroller to display real-time temperature readings on the 7-segment displays. You can use different colors or flashing patterns to indicate temperature ranges.

3. **Countdown Timer:**
   - Implement a countdown timer with adjustable time settings. This could be useful for various purposes, such as cooking, workout sessions, or other timed activities.

4. **Dice Simulator:**
   - Create a virtual dice game using the 7-segment displays to simulate the roll of multiple dice. It's a fun and interactive way to showcase your project.

5. **Scoreboard for Games:**
   - Design a scoreboard for a simple game, such as a quiz or a two-player game. Each microcontroller can represent a player's score or other relevant game information.

6. **Weather Station:**
   - Connect sensors for humidity, temperature, and pressure to each microcontroller, and display the current weather conditions on the 7-segment displays.

7. **Music Visualizer:**
   - Use audio input or a microphone to capture sound, and represent different aspects of the audio signal on the 7-segment displays. This could include volume levels, frequency bands, or rhythm patterns.

8. **Random Number Generator:**
   - Turn your project into a random number generator. This could be used for games, drawings, or any situation where randomness is needed.

9. **Binary Clock:**
   - Display the current time in binary format using the 7-segment displays. It's a unique and educational way to represent time.

10. **Fitness Tracker:**
    - Interface with sensors like accelerometers or heart rate monitors and display fitness-related metrics, such as step count or heart rate, on the 7-segment displays.
